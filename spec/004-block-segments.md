## 4. Block Segments

---

### Paragraph

**Syntax:** Any non-blank lines that do not match another block construct.

A contiguous run of non-blank lines not matched by any other block type. Once a paragraph begins, no block element can interrupt it — it continues until a blank line.

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface Paragraph {
  type: "Paragraph"
  children: Inline[]
  attributes: Attribute[]
}
```

- All lines are **parsed by inline rules** and concatenated. Result is `Inline[]`.
- A single newline between lines is a **soft break** — folded to zero; lines concatenate directly with no character emitted.
- A single trailing space before the newline is preserved as `Text(" ")` (explicit word boundary).
- `\` at line end produces a `TextBreak` node (explicit line break).

**Example:**

```
Input:
  First line
  second line\
  third line

AST:
  Paragraph
  ├── Text("First linesecond line")
  ├── TextBreak
  └── Text("third line")
```

---

### ThematicBreak

**Syntax:** `--- {attrs}`

Three or more consecutive `-` at line start. Any characters between the dashes and the optional `{attrs}` are silently dropped.

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface ThematicBreak {
  type: "ThematicBreak"
  attributes: Attribute[]
}
```

- At **Page scope**: creates a page break — a new `Page` is opened and the `ThematicBreak` node becomes its first child.
- Inside a **block container** (`ListItem`, `TaskItem`, `QuoteBlock`, `NamedBlock`): emits a `ThematicBreak` node but does **not** create a new Page.

**Examples:**

```
---              → ThematicBreak {}
--- {.page-end}  → ThematicBreak { attributes: { class: ["page-end"] } }
--- some text    → ThematicBreak {}  (text dropped)
```

---

### CodeBlock

**Syntax:** Fenced with exactly three backticks.

````
```language {attrs}
content
```
````

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface CodeBlock {
  type: "CodeBlock"
  language: string  // default: "text"
  content: string
  attributes: Attribute[]
}
```

- Language identifier uses `[ID_LITERAL]+`. Defaults to `"text"` when absent.
- Content is **literal** — no inline parsing. Lines joined with `\n`; no trailing `\n` appended. Blank lines preserved verbatim.
- Fixed 3-backtick fence. Variable-length fences not supported. No nesting.
- Unclosed fence: content runs to end of document → warning CDN-0001.
- Legal inside `ListItem`, `TaskItem`, `QuoteBlock`, `NamedBlock`. Container indentation is stripped from content lines.

---

### Meta

**Syntax:** Fenced with exactly three tildes.

```
~~~format
content
~~~
```

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface Meta {
  type: "Meta"
  format: "yaml" | "toml" | "json"  // default: "yaml"
  raw: string
}
```

- Recognized formats: `yaml`, `toml`, `json` (case-insensitive). Default: `"yaml"`.
- Content is a raw string passed as-is to the consumer. Lines joined with `\n`; a single trailing `\n` is appended.
- Always fills `Page.meta`. If `Page.meta` is already set, opens a new Page first. Never appears in `Page.children`.
- Only valid at Page scope. Inside block containers, the entire span is emitted as a `Paragraph` → warning CDN-0013.
- Unclosed fence → warning CDN-0002.
- No `attributes` field.

**Example:**

```
~~~yaml
title: My Document
~~~
```

---

### QuoteBlock

**Syntax:** Lines prefixed with `>`.

```
> content
> more content
>> nested quote
```

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface QuoteBlock {
  type: "QuoteBlock"
  children: Block[]
  attributes: Attribute[]
}
```

- Every line MUST begin with `>`. No lazy continuation — a line without `>` ends the quote.
- The `>` prefix and one optional following space are stripped. Content is parsed as full block content.
- Nesting: `>>` = blockquote inside blockquote. Both `>>` and `> >` are valid. Depth = count of leading `>` characters.

---

### List

**Syntax:** One or more list items sharing a common indentation level.

```
- unordered item
  - nested item

1. ordered item
2. second item

- [ ] task item
- [x] checked task
```

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface List {
  type: "List"
  ordered: boolean
  start: number | null  // first item number for ordered lists; null for unordered
  loose: boolean
  children: (ListItem | TaskItem)[]
  attributes: Attribute[]
}
```

- Unordered marker: `-` followed by one space. Only `-` is supported.
- Ordered marker: `{number}.` followed by one space. Only `.` delimiter; `)` is not supported. Actual numbers are ignored except for `start`.
- `ordered` is determined by the **first item's marker**.
- **Tight vs loose:** A list is `loose: true` when a blank line appears between items within the list scope. `loose` is an advisory flag for consumers — the parser does not alter children based on it.
- A blank line followed by a col-0 marker ends the current list and starts a new `List` node.

---

#### ListItem

**Syntax:** A list marker followed by content, with optional indented continuation lines.

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface ListItem {
  type: "ListItem"
  children: (Section | Block | Inline)[]
  attributes: Attribute[]
}
```

- Content on the marker line is **parsed by inline rules**. Continuation lines at the same or deeper indentation are absorbed.
- When a blank line is absorbed inside the list (loose list), content is block-promoted: `children` becomes `Block[]` (e.g. `Paragraph`).
- Attributes follow the scope-chain rule (§6).

---

#### TaskItem

**Syntax:** `- [ ] content` or `- [x] content`

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface TaskItem {
  type: "TaskItem"
  checked: boolean
  children: (Section | Block | Inline)[]
  attributes: Attribute[]
}
```

- Marker: `- ` followed immediately by `[ ]` (unchecked) or `[x]`/`[X]` (checked), then one space and content.
- Only unordered list items may carry a checkbox. An ordered list item never produces a `TaskItem`.
- A `List` may contain a mix of `ListItem` and `TaskItem` children.
- Follows the same multiline and block-promotion rules as `ListItem`.

**Example:**

```
Input:
  - [ ] Buy milk
  - [x] Write spec
  - plain item

AST:
  List { ordered: false, loose: false }
  ├── TaskItem { checked: false, children: [Text("Buy milk")] }
  ├── TaskItem { checked: true,  children: [Text("Write spec")] }
  └── ListItem { children: [Text("plain item")] }
```

---

### Table

**Syntax:** `| ... |` — leading and trailing `|` required on every row.

Two variants distinguished by the presence of a delimiter row:

```
| Cell A | Cell B |           ← simple table (no header)

| Name   | Score |            ← GFM table
|:-------|------:|
| Alice  |    42 |
```

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface Table {
  type: "Table"
  kind: "simple" | "gfm"
  head: Row[] | null   // null for simple tables
  body: Row[]
  columns: Column[]
  attributes: Attribute[]
}

interface Row {
  type: "Row"
  children: Cell[]
  attributes: Attribute[]
}

interface Cell {
  type: "Cell"
  children: Inline[]
  row: number     // zero-indexed
  column: number  // zero-indexed
}

interface Column {
  type: "Column"
  align: "left" | "right" | "center" | "comma" | "decimal"  // default: "left"
}
```

- `Cell` content is **parsed by inline rules**. Result is `Inline[]`.
- `Cell` and `Column` do not carry `attributes`.
- Colspan and rowspan are not supported.
- Delimiter row alignment: `:---` left, `---:` right, `:---:` center, `---,` comma, `---.` decimal.
- `Row` and `Table` attributes follow the scope-chain rule (§6): last `{}` → `Table`; preceding `{}` → `Row`. The `Table` slot is only available from the **last row's** chain.

**Row/Table attribute examples:**

```
| td1 | td2 | {.a}{.b}  →  Table({.b}, Row({.a}, ...))
| td1 | td2 | {.a}      →  Table({.a}, Row(...))         ← single {} = Table slot
Mid-table row:
| td1 | td2 | {.a}      →  Row({.a}, ...)                ← 1 slot only
```

---

### FileRef

**Syntax:** `/path/to/file.ext {attrs}`

Any line beginning with `/` is a file reference block.

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface FileRef {
  type: "FileRef"
  src: string
  fragment: string | null
  query: string | null
  group: "image" | "video" | "audio" | null
  attributes: Attribute[]
}
```

- Path uses `PATH_LITERAL` characters: `[a-zA-Z0-9._/-]`. Spaces not allowed.
- Fragment (`#`): everything from the first `#` to the next space (or end of line, before `{attrs}`) is extracted as `fragment`. `src` stores the portion before `#`.
- Query (`?`): if path contains `?`, the parser extracts the query string as `query`. `src` stores the portion before `?`.
- `group` is set automatically by file extension (see Known Groups below). Consumers may configure the extension lists.
- Unknown-extension files have `group: null` and are never grouped.

**Known Groups (defaults):**

| Group   | Extensions |
|---------|-----------|
| `image` | `.png` `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.gif` `.webp` `.svg` |
| `video` | `.mp4` `.avi` `.mov` |
| `audio` | `.mp3` `.wav` `.aac` `.ogg` |

---

### FileRefGroup

Consecutive `FileRef` or `ImageBlock` lines of the **same known group** with no blank line between them are automatically wrapped in a `FileRefGroup`. Not produced by explicit syntax — assembled during parsing.

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface FileRefGroup {
  type: "FileRefGroup"
  group: "image" | "video" | "audio"
  children: (FileRef | ImageBlock)[]
  attributes: Attribute[]
}
```

- A blank line breaks any active group.
- Different groups do not merge — two consecutive lines of different groups produce two separate `FileRefGroup` nodes.
- Unknown-extension files are never grouped.

**Example:**

```
Input:
  /photos/a.png
  /photos/b.jpg
  /docs/report.pdf

AST:
  FileRefGroup { group: "image" }
  ├── FileRef { src: "/photos/a.png", group: "image" }
  └── FileRef { src: "/photos/b.jpg", group: "image" }
  FileRef { src: "/docs/report.pdf", group: null }
```

---

### ImageBlock

**Syntax:** `![alt text](src) {attrs}`

A line at block level beginning with `![` is classified as an `ImageBlock`.

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface ImageBlock {
  type: "ImageBlock"
  alt: Inline[]
  src: string
  attributes: Attribute[]
}
```

- `alt` is **parsed by inline rules**. Result is `Inline[]`.
- Consecutive `ImageBlock` lines with no blank line between them are wrapped in a `FileRefGroup { group: "image" }`.
- `ImageBlock` is the block-level counterpart of `ImageInline` (§5). The difference is that `ImageBlock` must be at the start of a line.

---

### NamedBlock

**Syntax:**

```
:::block-name {attrs}
  content
:::
```

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface NamedBlock {
  type: "NamedBlock"
  name: string
  children: Block[]
  attributes: Attribute[]
}
```

- Opening: `:::` followed immediately by a block name (`[ID_LITERAL]+`), then optional attributes.
- Closing: `:::` on its own line (no name).
- A `:::` opener not followed immediately by an `ID_LITERAL` character does NOT open a NamedBlock — classified as a Paragraph → warning CDN-0013.
- Content: any block content, including nested `:::` containers.
- Unclosed container: content runs to end of document → warning CDN-0004.
- **Indentation collapsing:** The first content line establishes the base indentation. That many leading spaces are stripped from all content lines before parsing.

**Example:**

```
:::callout {.warning}
  > quoted text
:::
→ NamedBlock { name: "callout", children: [QuoteBlock([Text("quoted text")])], attributes: {class:["warning"]} }
```

---

### RefDefinition

**Syntax:** `[^id]: inline content`

MUST start at the beginning of a line.

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface RefDefinition {
  type: "RefDefinition"
  id: string
  children: Inline[]
  attributes: Attribute[]
}
```

- `id` uses `[ID_LITERAL]+`. Case-sensitive.
- Content is **parsed by inline rules**. Result is `Inline[]`.
- **Last definition wins** when multiple definitions share the same `id`. This allows a host document to override any definition from a transcluded fragment.
- Cutdown does not validate that every `[^id]` link has a matching definition.

---

### MathBlock

**Syntax:** Fenced with exactly three dollar signs.

```
$$$ {attrs}
\LaTeX formula
$$$
```

**AST type:**

```typescript
interface MathBlock {
  type: "MathBlock"
  formula: string
  attributes: Attribute[]
}
```

- Content is **literal** — no inline parsing. Passed as raw string to the consumer (KaTeX or equivalent).
- Lines joined with `\n`; no trailing `\n` appended. Blank lines preserved verbatim.
- Unclosed fence: content runs to end of document → warning CDN-0003.
- Legal inside block containers. Indentation handling follows the same rules as `CodeBlock`.

**Example:**

```
Input:
  $$$ {.display #eq1}
  \int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
  $$$

AST:
  MathBlock {
    formula: "\\int_0^\\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}",
    attributes: { id: "eq1", class: ["display"] }
  }
```
